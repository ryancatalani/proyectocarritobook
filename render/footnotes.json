Complicating the understanding and experience of this conflict is that members of one group often switch sides to another group. This switching happens because for many impoverished people, being part of an armed group is not based on a political ideology but instead on the fact that it is a job, a way to support their family.

This form is called the DS-160. See U.S. Department of State “Worldwide Deployment of the DS-160.” All visa application questions referenced in this article come from the online DS-160 Nonimmigrant Travel Visa Application required of all Colombians applying to travel to the United States. See https://ceac.state.gov/GENNIV/default.aspx. The narrative account of what Farconely would have to do to apply for a Nonimmigrant Travel Visa from Colombia to the United States is based on my past ten years of working with dozens of Colombians as they apply for these visas. These visa applications have been for my family members, university students and faculty, and artists. The latter is for a transnational youth art and human rights project I co-founded and direct called Proyecto Boston Medellín. See http://mobilitymovilidad.org. The first visa application for my mother-in-law to attend my wedding to her son was denied. The second application was accepted but required me to send proof that I was indeed inviting her to the United States to help care for her newborn granddaughter. This proof required an inch-thick packet of legal documents, including notarized letters from friends accounting for the “goodness” of “my character,” ultrasound images of my womb and a notarized letter signed by my doctor that the unborn baby in the ultrasound images was indeed inside my body. As of the publication of this article, we have not yet applied for a travel visa to bring a desplazada to accompany her story across the border to the United States.
